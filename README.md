# Flappy Bird Game Clone

This is a clone of Flappy Bird Game made using Java, libGDX framework, and Android Studio.

# libGDX framework

It is a free open-source game development framework that helps in development of desktop and mobile games. This beautiful documentation link helps to get started with the frameowrk: https://libgdx.com/dev/

# Android Studio

It is an IDE that helps us create apps for Android OS. 

# Steps

- First download the libGDX executable jar file. After opening it, you'll get a libGDX project setup.

- Fill out the basic details like name, package name, class name, destination of the project according to your choice.
- While installing the android studio, you'll get pre-installed SDK. And you can find the path by going to File-> Settings->System Settings-> Android SDK.
There on top you can find it.

-  Else if you have installed an Android SDK independently then give the path to it.
-  After the path, you can choose the platforms you want your game to be deployed on starting from web page, desktop, android and ios. In this case, I just chose desktop and android.
-  Select the extensions according to your need, in this case we just use Box2D
-  Then click on 'Generate'. It takes a while to create the project.
-  Once the project is created successfully, we can open it through Android Studio and write the code the way I have written in the uploaded files of my repository.
